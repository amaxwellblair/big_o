## Big O notation

### Overview

**What is Big O notation?**

Big O notation's technical mathematical definition:

> Big O notation describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, usually in terms of simpler functions

A practical definition of Big O notation:

> Big O notation describes the efficiency of an algorithm through a simplified mathematical function

**Why should I care?**

A simple answer would be because employers care:

A more complex answer(rant):

Efficiency in programming determines skill. The more efficient the programmer the more money they can command in the job market. When a novice programmer thinks of efficiency speed typically comes to mind. Typing speed, file navigation speed, feedback loop speed are a few examples of how speed can affect efficiency. Although an argument can be made that these have nothing to do with with programming.

The first step of understanding efficiency in programming can be thought of as 'less code is better'. For instance a 100 line program that feeds your dog versus a 10 line program that feeds your dog. Most would assume that the 10 line program is more efficient.

The second steeper step of understanding efficiency in programming can be thought of as 'code that does less is better'. For example a function that feeds your dog. Method_1 to feed the dog would be to buy a new bag of dog food every day then proceed to feed the dog. Method_2 to feed the dog would be to check if there is dog food (if not go buy some) then feed the dog.

Method_1 and Method_2 do the same thing. Although if thought of as 'code that does less is better' Method_2 is more efficient.
- On average Method_1 will cost the time it took to get to the dog food store plus the time it takes to feed the dog.
- On average Method_2 will cost somewhere between the time it took to get to the dog food store and the time it takes to feed the dog.

This example clearly demonstrates that Method_2 is more efficient than Method_1 on the basis of time spent. In the world of computer science programs or algorithms efficiency is thought of on the basis of Big O. So in order to make an efficient algorithm a programmer must have some knowledge of the principles of Big O. Do programmers actually need to know Big O in order to apply Big O is another story!
